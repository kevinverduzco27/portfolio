What did you learn? The amount of think im going to take home from this project are alot. frist things first i learned that making custom picture can be so time consuming and that i really have to make sure that they all have the same format. second i really need to over the basics again an really serch deep and pratice it on my own time an that in this boot camp if im going to succed i have to do alot more on my own time, trufully this was a prety stressfully expereince sense it made me have to restart a couple of time but i think it alos showed me that i have to start witha  better more maleable structure.
